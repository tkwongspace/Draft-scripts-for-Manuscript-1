# Draft scripts for Manuscript #1

All scripts here were drafts for data testing on time series analysis in a subtropical mangrove forest.

The manuscript was published on [*Frontiers in Forests and Global Change*](https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2023.1183432) , 
and useful scripts are now available in the repository [FrontForGlobChange_2023](https://github.com/tkwongspace/FrontForGlobChange_2023).

This repository can therefore be archived.
